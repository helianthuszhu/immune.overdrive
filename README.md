####### This is the main codes for analysis TE signature in CRC
### 'work.flow_get_candidate_TEs.R' contains main scripts for candidate TEs.
### 'clin.data.CRC.selected.R' is main script for CRC sample selection.
### Folder under '2.survival.TE.screen' contains the analysis of survival-associated TEs.
### Folder under '3.immu.correlated/stat.20200405' contains the analysis of immune-associated TEs.
### Folder under '4.model' contains the analyis based on identification of TE clusters.
### Folder under '5.TE.cor.with.gene' is for identification of genes correlated with TE score.
### Folder under '9.AZAdata.GBM' is for analysis of DNA methylation inhibitors treated cell lines data.
### Folder under 'scRNA' is for identification of transcriptomes and TE expression in scRNA.
### 'run.java.gsea.TE4vsother.sh' is the script for gsea analysis.
